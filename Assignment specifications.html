    <h2>Clarifications and Corrections</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	3/5/20: Added medley swim stroke video and clarified requirement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      This assignment uses three.js to implement a swim race in an
      olympic size pool. In part it builds on assignment 2.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a basic assignment the swimmers will just glide up and down
      the pool with random speeds with no swim stroke action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next step up is to implement a simple swim stroke animation,
      where arms simply rotate about the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then next step up is to implement keyframe animation in
      Javascript, instead of using an inbuilt or library provided
      keyframe engine as in assignment 1, along with a keyframed
      swimming action. As shown in the images and video above.
    </p>

    <p>
      The highest level assignment is to implement a <em>medley</em>
      swim race.  A medley is a swim race of four different strokes:
      backstroke, breastroke, butterfly and freestyle. All four
      swim strokes are shown in the video below, and should be implemented
      using keyframe animation. 
    </p>

    <h2>Details</h2>

    
    <p>
      Extend your program from assignment 2 to render a swim race
      with eight swimmers in a pool. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	A swimming race with 8 swimmers in a 20m x 50m, 8
	× 2.5m lane wide, 2.5m deep olympic pool. Random numbers
	are to be used to generated the speed of the swimmers, which may
	vary in a race. The swimmers do two lengths of the
	pool, as though in a 100m race. In the HD level assignment
	swimmers do a 200m medley which is 4 laps, each with a
	different stroke: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle.
      </li>
      <li>
	Texture mapping of the pool and the swimmers.
      </li>
      <li>
	Animating the swimmers in two ways: (1) simply moving them
	along the length of the pool (and back) with no swim stroke action 
	(2) performing a swim stroke action using key frame animaton
	similar to the first assignment but with the keyframe animation
	implemented in Javascript.
      </li>
    </ul>

    
      
    <h2>
      Further Details
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Use your hierarchical swimmer model from assignment 2.
	In case you did not get that done, 
	use a block to represent the swimmers.
      </li>
      <li>
	Include
	the same rendering controls: axes, lighting, wireframe.
      </li>
      <li>
        The figure must be properly constructed according to the same
        hierarchy, to allow for easy animation. The figure must have a
        root node such as the body or a blank container node to allow the
        whole swimmer to be moved around the scene.
      </li>
      <li>
        There should be a root scene object
	of which all components are children so that any
        transformations will transform the entire scene.
      </li>
      <li>
        The swimmer should be able to be easily duplicated using a
        createSwimmer() function or something similar, such as the
        clone() method on the root node of the swimmer.
      </li>
      <li>
	The race should start when the 'g' button is pressed, not before.
      </li>
      <li>
        The swimmers will race from one end of the pool to the
	other, and then back. Each swimmer
        will have a random speed which can vary as the race proceeds.
	Use the speed to change the position of the swimmers using
	time deltas. 
      </li>
      <li>
	The swimmers color should be a shade of pink 0xff9966 ( or
	(255, 153, 102) or (1, 0.6, 0.4)).
      </li>
      <li>
	A simple swim stroke animation approach is to have the arms constantly
	rotating around the shoulder.
      </li>
      <li>
        A detailed swimmer stroke animation should be keyframed,
	as in assignment 1, with a keyframe animation engine 
	implemented in Javascript using the interpolator discussed in
	the lectures and tutorials, and the functions:
        <pre>        function interpolate(keys, values, key)
        function lerp(k1, v1, k2, v2, k)
        function findInterval(keys, key)
	</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Code should be simply annotated so that its easy to identify
        the different areas of your program. The assignment should be
        split into several logical files based on the content of the
        file.
      </li>
      
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Textures
    </h2>
    <p>
      The pool is to be textured with tiles using the texture image
      below, but <a href="./Web3D Assignment 3_files/tiles.jpg">download</a> and use the full
      size tile image. This tiles image is used in
      	the <a href="http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/">the webgl
      	water demo</a>, but was created by
      <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zooboing/3682834083/">zooboing</a> on Flickr</p>

    <p>
      The swimmers torsos are to be textured - both front and back:
